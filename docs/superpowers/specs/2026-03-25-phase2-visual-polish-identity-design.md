# Phase 2 Design Spec — Visual Polish & Identity

**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Status:** Approved
**Scope:** Visual polish, overlay differentiation, signature moments — no architecture changes
**Depends on:** Phase 1 HUD redesign (completed)

---

## Design Principles (Hard Rules)

1. **No architecture changes.** Block layout, zone structure, and component hierarchy from Phase 1 are frozen.
2. **Glow budget: max 2 protagonist glows per screen.** Hero piece (top) and CTA button (bottom) are the two. Inner glows for state (owned badge, active exercise) do NOT count toward this limit — they are ambient, not hierarchical.
3. **Accent by role.** Each overlay family has one accent color. No mixing. No gradients across families.
4. **Animation budget: 1 signature animation per screen.** Hero selector gets the "plop". Victory gets sparkles. Other screens are static.
5. **Glow must feel like halo, not LED.** If a glow competes with adjacent elements (target label, utility actions), reduce intensity until it recedes. The test: squint at the screen — glow should be atmosphere, not a point light.

## 1. Hero Selector Polish

### Piece Scale

| Element | Phase 1 | Phase 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Hero circle | `h-16 w-16` (64px) | Unchanged |
| Hero icon | `text-2xl` (24px) | `text-3xl` (30px) |
| Hero border | `border-2 border-cyan-400/45` | `border-2 border-cyan-300/60` |
| Hero glow | `shadow-[0_0_16px_rgba(34,211,238,0.20)]` | `shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(34,211,238,0.30)]` |
| Hero bg | `bg-cyan-500/[0.12]` | `bg-gradient-to-b from-cyan-400/15 to-cyan-600/8` |
| Piece label | `text-[7px] font-bold text-cyan-200` | `text-[8px] font-extrabold tracking-[0.15em] text-cyan-100` |
| Inactive circle | `h-9 w-9` (36px) | `h-8 w-8` (32px) visual default. Fall back to `h-[34px] w-[34px]` if real-device legibility suffers. **Touch target must remain 40-44px** regardless of visual size (use invisible padding or `min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px]` on the button). |
| Inactive opacity | `opacity-30` | `opacity-[0.22]` |
| Target value | `text-lg` (18px) | `text-xl` (20px) `font-black` (weight 900) |

**Glow guardrail (takes priority over nominal value):** If the hero halo visually bleeds into the target label or utility band actions on device, reduce shadow immediately — do not ship the nominal value. Fall back to `shadow-[0_0_16px_rgba(34,211,238,0.22)]`. The halo must frame the piece, not flood the zone. The guardrail overrides the table above.

### Signature Animation: Piece Selection "Plop"

When the active piece changes, the new hero gets a micro scale-bounce:

```
0%   → scale(0.95)
40%  → scale(1.03)
100% → scale(1.0)
```

Duration: `300ms`, easing: `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`. Implemented as a CSS keyframe `hero-plop` applied via a transient class toggled on piece change.

**Trigger rule:** The plop fires only on actual `selectedPiece` value changes — not on re-renders, mounts, or other state updates. Implementation: track previous piece via ref, compare on render, apply transient class only when `prev !== current`.

Only the hero circle animates. Inactive pieces transition smoothly with `transition-all duration-200`.

## 2. Board Stage Polish

### Vignette

Add an inset shadow to the board container to darken edges and focus the eye on the center:

```
shadow-[inset_0_0_40px_rgba(0,0,0,0.3)]
```

Applied to the board wrapper div. The board image itself is unchanged. The vignette is a CSS-only effect on the container.

### Board Corners

Add `rounded-lg overflow-hidden` to the board wrapper. Gives the board soft corners without clipping gameplay elements.

### Footer Transition Line

Between board and footer, add a `1px` gradient line:

```tsx
<div className="h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-cyan-400/10 to-transparent" />
```

This is a whisper of a line — exists as a visual transition, not a separator. If it feels heavy on device, reduce to `via-cyan-400/6`.

**Priority:** Medium. These are feel improvements, not identity-critical.

---

## 3. Overlay Differentiation

### Accent Color System

| Overlay | Accent | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Exercise Drawer | Cyan (`cyan-500`) | Tactical, progress |
| Shop + Purchase Confirm | Amber (`amber-500`) | Premium, commerce |
| Badges | Emerald (`emerald-500`) | Achievement, collection |
| Leaderboard | Purple (`purple-500`) | Competitive, ranking |
| Errors | Rose (`rose-500`) | Failure, warning |
| Neutral/Navigation | White/Slate | Generic, no accent |

### Accent Stripe

A `2px` (`h-0.5`) gradient line at the very top of each sheet overlay, immediately below the drag handle. **Applies to sheet overlays only** — not to inline confirms (Back to Hub, Resign) or modal overlays (victory, coach).

```tsx
<div className="h-0.5 w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-{accent}-500/40 via-{accent}-400/20 to-{accent}-500/40" />
```

**Rules:**
- Very fine and elegant — graphic signature, not a separator
- No glow, no shadow, no animation
- Fades to transparent at edges (the gradient handles this)
- Must not compete with the sheet title or content

### Title Icon Badge

A `20px` icon to the left of the sheet title:

```tsx
<SheetTitle className="fantasy-title text-cyan-50 flex items-center gap-2">
  <IconComponent size={20} className="text-{accent}-400/40" />
  {title}
</SheetTitle>
```

| Sheet | Icon | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Exercise Drawer | `Crosshair` | `cyan-400/40` |
| Shop | `ShoppingBag` | `amber-400/40` |
| Purchase Confirm | `ShoppingBag` | `amber-400/40` |
| Badges | `Trophy` | `emerald-400/40` |
| Leaderboard | `Crown` | `purple-400/40` |

Icon opacity is `40%` — present but subordinate. It adds identity without competing with content.

**Priority:** High. This is the core visual differentiation system.

## 4. Signature Components — 4 Featured Moments

### Moment 1: Selected Piece (hero selector)

Covered in Section 1. The "plop" animation + enhanced glow + gradient bg make the selection feel like choosing your card.

### Moment 2: Back to Hub Confirm (arena HUD)

The inline confirm pattern already works well. Polish only:

- Confirming state: add `backdrop-blur-sm` to the button for a momentary "pause" feel
- Border: `border-white/20` → `border-white/30` in confirm state
- No other changes — the countdown bar is already signature

### Moment 3: Owned Badge (badge sheet)

Current owned badge card: `bg-emerald-500/10 ring-1 ring-emerald-500/20` — flat, same weight as claimable.

**Enhanced owned state:**

```tsx
<div className="bg-emerald-500/10 ring-1 ring-emerald-500/20 shadow-[inset_0_0_16px_rgba(16,185,129,0.12)] relative">
  {/* Existing badge content */}

  {/* Owned check badge — top right */}
  <span className="absolute -right-1 -top-1 flex h-5 w-5 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-emerald-500 text-[10px] font-bold text-white shadow-[0_0_8px_rgba(16,185,129,0.3)]">
    &#10003;
  </span>
</div>
```

The inner glow (`inset shadow`) is ambient — it does NOT count toward the glow budget. The check badge is a permanent trophy marker. Together they make "owned" feel like a real achievement, not just a state toggle.

### Moment 4: Featured Store Item (shop sheet)

Current: all items have identical `rune-frame` styling.

**Featured item enhancement:**

```tsx
<div className="rune-frame relative ring-2 ring-amber-400/30">
  {/* Tiny FEATURED label */}
  <span className="absolute -top-2.5 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 rounded-full bg-amber-500/15 border border-amber-400/25 px-2 py-0.5 text-[8px] font-bold uppercase tracking-widest text-amber-400/60">
    Featured
  </span>

  {/* Existing item content */}
</div>
```

**Rules:**
- The FEATURED label is tiny and subordinate — never competes with price or CTA
- `ring-2 ring-amber-400/30` replaces the default ring — stronger but still subtle
- Only 1 item can be featured at a time
- **Default selection:** first purchasable premium item, unless a product-level override specifies otherwise
- The label floats above the card (negative top position), not inside it
- The label is tiny and subordinate — must never compete with price or CTA
- No glow on the label itself

**Priority:** High.

## 5. About Page — Same Universe

### Background

Replace `bg-[#0b1220]` with `mission-shell` class on the container. This gives it the same dark gradient/texture as the game screens.

### Logo

Add halo glow:

```
drop-shadow-[0_0_24px_rgba(103,232,249,0.15)]
```

### Title "Chesscito"

Add text glow to match game world:

```
drop-shadow-[0_0_8px_rgba(103,232,249,0.2)]
```

### Nav Links

Replace `bg-cyan-950/40 rounded-xl` with:

```
rounded-2xl border border-white/[0.06] bg-white/[0.03] hover:bg-white/[0.06]
```

Same visual family as dock items and utility elements — part of the game, not a settings page.

**Tone guardrail:** The about page shares the game's visual universe but must remain calmer than gameplay or reward screens. No glows, no animations, no accent colors. It's the "quiet room" of the product.

**Priority:** Low. These are cheap wins but not identity-critical.

## 6. Implementation Priority

### High Priority (identity-critical)
1. Hero selector polish (icon size, glow, gradient bg, inactive scale, label, plop animation)
2. Overlay accent stripes + title icon badges (all 4 sheets)
3. Featured store item (ring + label)
4. Owned badge state (inner glow + check badge)

### Medium Priority (feel improvements)
5. Board vignette + corners + footer transition line
6. Back to hub confirm polish (backdrop-blur + border)
7. Target value size bump (text-xl, font-black)

### Low Priority (cheap wins)
8. About page (mission-shell bg, logo glow, nav link restyle, title glow)

---

## Out of Scope

- Layout or architecture changes (frozen from Phase 1)
- New components or screens
- Arena HUD redesign (future phase)
- New animations beyond the hero plop
- Desktop viewport considerations
- Exercise drawer sheet content redesign
- Victory overlay redesign (already has sparkles + halos)
